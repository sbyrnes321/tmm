"""
Functions to calculate the color of a multilayer thin film under reflected
light. A perfect mirror will look white, because we imagine seeing the white
light source ("illuminant") reflected in it. A half-reflective mirror will be
gray, a non-reflective surface will be black, etc. See tmm.examples.sample5()
for a few example calculations for how this is used.

For functions that require an illuminant, the most common choice would be to
use colorpy.illuminants.get_illuminant_D65(), which approximates a phase of
natural daylight. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminant_D65 .

    """
    Calculate the reflection spectrum of a thin-film stack.

    n_fn_list[m] should be a function that inputs wavelength in nm and
    outputs refractive index of the m'th layer. In other words,
    n_fn_list[2](456) == 1.53 + 0.4j mans that layer #2 has a refractive index
    of 1.53 + 0.4j at 456nm. These functions could be defined with
    scipy.interpolate.interp1d() for example.

    pol, d_list and th_0 are defined as in tmm.coh_tmm ... but d_list
    MUST be in units of nanometers

    spectral_range can be 'full' if all the functions in n_fn_list can take
    wavelength arguments between 360-830nm; or 'narrow' if some or all require
    arguments only in the range 400-700nm. The wavelengths outside the
    'narrow' range make only a tiny difference to the color, because they are
    almost invisible to the eye. If spectral_range is 'narrow', then the n(400)
    values are used for 360-400 and n(700) for 700-830nm

    Returns a 2-column array where the first column is wavelength in nm
    (360,361,362,...,830) and the second column is reflectivity (from 0
    to 1, where 1 is a perfect mirror). This range is chosen to be
    consistent with colorpy.illuminants. See  colorpy.ciexyz.start_wl_nm etc.

      (Specifically, it's scaled to get Y=1 for a perfect reflector.)
    * scale='Y1' means that the intensity is increased or decreased in
      order to set Y (the luminance) to 1. So you can get white but not gray,
      you can get orange but not brown, etc.
